# Solidity API

## PrivateToken

_Implementation of PrivateToken.
total supply is set at construction by the deployer and cannot exceed type(uint40).max = 1099511627775 because during Exponential ElGamal decryption we must solve the DLP quickly
Balances are encrypted to each owner's public key, according to the registered keys inside the PublicKeyInfrastructure.
Because we use Exponential ElGamal encryption, each EncryptedAmount is a pair of points on Baby Jubjub (C1,C2) = ((C1x,C1y),(C2x,C2y))._

### deposit

```solidity
function deposit(address _from, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _to, uint40 _processFee) public
```

Deposits the assocated token into the contract to be used privately.
The deposited amount is pushed to the recepients PendingDeposits queue. The fee
is the amount that will be paid to the processor of the tx (when processPendingDeposits
is called)
This function converts the token to 2 decimal places, the remainder is lost.

#### Parameters

| Name         | Type    | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_from       | address | - sender of the tokens, an ETH address                                                               |
| \_amount     | uint256 | - amount to deposit                                                                                  |
| \_to         | bytes32 | - the packed public key of the recipient in the system                                               |
| \_processFee | uint40  | - (optional, can be 0) amount to pay the processor of the tx (when processPendingDeposits is called) |

### transferLocals

This functions transfers an encrypted amount of tokens to the recipient (\_to).
If the sender is sending to an account with a 0 balance, they can omit the fee, as the funds
will be directly added to their account. Otherwise a fee can be specified to incentivize
processing of the tx by an unknown third party (see processPendingTranfer). This is required
two account cannot simultaneously update the encrypted balance of the recipient. Having a pending
transfer queue allows the sender to always succeed in debiting their account, and the recipient
receiving the funds.
The account must not be locked to a contract to call this function.

### processPendingDeposit

```solidity
function processPendingDeposit(bytes _proof, uint256[] _txsToProcess, address _feeRecipient, bytes32 _recipient, struct PrivateToken.EncryptedAmount _zeroBalance, struct PrivateToken.EncryptedAmount _newBalance) public
```

the circuit processing this takes in a fixes number of pending transactions.
It will take up to 4 at a time (TODO: research how big this num should this be?).
The circuit checks that the publicKey and recipient match. it encrypts the totalAmount
and adds it to the recipients encrypted balance. It checks that the provided encrypted
balance and the calculated encrypted balances match.

### processPendingTransfer

```solidity
function processPendingTransfer(bytes _proof, uint8[] _txsToProcess, address _feeRecipient, bytes32 _recipient, struct PrivateToken.EncryptedAmount _newBalance) public

It will take up to 4 at a time (TODO: research how big this num should this be?). The circuit adds all of the encrypted amounts sent
and then checks that the \_newBalance is the sum of the old balance and the sum of the
amounts to add. All of the fees are summed and sent to the \_feeRecipient

#### Parameters

| Name              | Type    | Description                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| \_packedPublicKey | bytes32 | The packed public key of the account to update                                       |
| \_ethAddress      | address | The eth address of the signer or the 4337 account                                    |
| \_proof           | bytes   | The proof that the caller has the private key corresponding to the packed public key |

### change4337Controller

```solidity
function change4337Controller(bytes32 _packedPublicKey, address _newAddress) public
```

This function updates the erc4337 controller. It must be called by the current 4337 controller.

_There is no proof validation required because the caller must be the current controller._

#### Parameters

| Name              | Type    | Description                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_packedPublicKey | bytes32 | The packed public key of the account to update                   |
| \_newAddress      | address | The new erc4337 controller address. Can be address(0) to revoke. |

### changeEthSigner

```solidity
function changeEthSigner(bytes _proof, bytes32 _packedPublicKey, address _newEthSignerAddress) public
```

This function updates the eth signer address. The proof will verify a signature from the current registered signer

_The message hash is calculated in the function to prevent replay attacks. The caller must sign the corresponding
hash and use it when generating the proof
See the change_eth_signer circuit for circuit details_

#### Parameters

| Name                  | Type    | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \_proof               | bytes   | The proof that the caller can create a signautre corresponding to the registered eth signer |
| \_packedPublicKey     | bytes32 | The packed public key of the account to update                                              |
| \_newEthSignerAddress | address | The new eth signer address. Can be address(0) to revoke.                                    |

### addMultisigEthSigners

```solidity
function addMultisigEthSigners(bytes _proof, bytes32 _packedPublicKey, address[] _ethSignerAddresses, uint256 _threshold) public
```

This function adds a multisig eth signer. It uses the addEthSignerVerifier circuit.
